The precomposed hangul syllables in the Hangul Syllables block in Unicode are algorithmically defined, using the following formula:

[(initial) × 588 + (medial) × 28 + (final)] + 44032
Initial consonants (18)ㄱㄲㄴㄷㄸㄹㅁㅂㅃㅅㅆㅇㅈㅉㅊㅋㅌㅍㅎ
Medial vowels (20)ㅏㅐㅑㅒㅓㅔㅕㅖㅗㅘㅙㅚㅛㅜㅝㅞㅟㅠㅡㅢㅣ
Final consonants (27) noneㄱㄲㄳㄴㄵㄶㄷㄹㄺㄻㄼㄽㄾㄿㅀㅁㅂㅄㅅㅆㅇㅈㅊㅋㅌㅍㅎ

For example, if one wants to find the code point of "한" in Unicode:

The value of initial consonant ㅎ is 18.The value of medial vowel ㅏ is 0.The value of final consonant ㄴ is 4.

Substituting these values to the formula above, one gets [(18 × 588) + (0 × 28) + 4] + 44032 = 54620. This means that the Unicode value of 한 is 54620 in decimal, &#54620;by the numeric character reference, and U+D55C in hexadecimal Unicode notation.

A written language like Hangul, but also able to incorporate unknown phonemes in the future, if not construct them.
